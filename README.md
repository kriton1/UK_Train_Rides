## About This Project

### Project Overview
The objective of the Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard for National Rail is to facilitate strategic decision-making by providing a clear visualization of key performance indicators (KPIs) that influence operational efficiency and revenue generation. This dashboard is designed to help identify profitable routes, optimize travel times, and enhance overall service reliability.

### Business Needs & Goals
- **Identification of High Revenue Routes**: Pinpoint routes that contribute significantly to revenue, enabling targeted improvements and marketing strategies.
- **Analysis of Peak Travel Times**: Understand customer travel patterns to manage capacity and improve service during high-demand periods.
- **Revenue Distribution by Ticket Type and Class**: Breakdown revenue streams to tailor pricing strategies that maximize profitability.
- **Diagnosis of On-Time Performance**: Identify and mitigate factors leading to delays and cancellations, focusing particularly on the most lucrative routes.

## Dashboard Features

- **KPIs and IBCS-like Bar Chart**: Visualizes month-over-month comparisons of Trips and Ticket Sales to highlight trends and anomalies.
- **Pareto Slicer**: Easily identify high-impact routes which show that popular routes are not always the most profitable.
- **Custom Sorting Options**: Users can intuitively sort data when comparing on-time performance across different routes.

## Data Insights and Strategic Recommendations

### Key Routes and Revenue Analysis
- While routes like Manchester Piccadilly to Liverpool Lime Street are popular, they do not yield revenue proportionate to their traffic. Conversely, routes such as London Kings Cross to York, despite similar traffic, account for a larger share of the revenue.
- **Strategic Focus**: Shift focus towards optimizing and marketing the higher revenue routes, specifically Liverpool Lime Street to London Euston.

### Booking Patterns and Opportunities
- Most bookings are made online and three days in advance, with a preference for standard class. The usage of railcards is low, indicating a potential area for growth.
- **Strategic Focus**: Develop promotions and incentives to increase railcard usage, especially targeting frequent and advanced bookings on profitable routes.

### Operational Challenges
- Approximately one-third of delays and cancellations are attributed to weather conditions, with significant disruptions also resulting from technical issues and staff shortages.
- **Strategic Focus**: Prioritize infrastructure and workforce improvements on high-revenue routes to reduce cancellations and delays. Implement robust contingency planning for adverse weather conditions.

### Peak Travel Times
- The analysis confirms peak times are typically from 6-8 AM and 5-6 PM.
- **Strategic Focus**: Ensure operational excellence during these times to handle the surge in passenger volume efficiently.
